      <h2>Terms of Service Agreement</h2>
      <p>Welcome to our course platform, where you can enroll in courses created by our brilliant course providers. By using our services, you agree to the following "Terms and Conditions" which have been expertly crafted to be as confusing, unreasonable, and completely in your favor as possible. Enjoy!</p>
      <h3>1. Your Commitment to Us (And by "Your", we mean you are totally bound to us)</h3>
      <p>By using this service, you agree to be an eternal slave to the digital abyss. This means, once you sign up, you can't really escape. Sure, you can close the tab, but we’ll be here, waiting for you. You may not have read these terms, and you may not have understood them, but tough luck, you're here now!

        You must enroll in courses. It’s not just an option. If you don't, we'll call you a quitter. We’ll definitely send you passive-aggressive emails reminding you of your failure to learn and contribute to society.</p>
      <h3>2. Your Data (We Own Your Soul)</h3>
      <p>You agree that all data provided to us is now our property. This includes, but is not limited to:

        Your name

        Your email

        Your search history (yes, we’ve been watching)

        Your hopes, dreams, and opinions on pineapple on pizza.

        Feel free to click "I agree" now, because later we’ll email you with unsolicited advice about how to live your life based on the data we collect.

        We’ll never share your data with third parties... unless we feel like it. Or unless we sell it to advertisers. Or unless it's "really important" for "security" reasons (we're making up the rules as we go along, really).</p>
      <h3>3. Course Providers: The Masters of the Universe</h3>
      <p>The course providers are your new gods. They’re responsible for creating, editing, and possibly ruining your learning experience. The platform is not liable for any damage done to your emotional or intellectual state due to their teaching style. Some providers may decide that "teaching" is too much effort and opt for some creative "life lessons" like, "just Google it" or "figure it out, kid."

        Refunds? Pfft, why would we give you a refund? It's a course. If you don't like it, that’s your fault for enrolling in the first place. Also, our refund policy is written in invisible ink.</p>
      <h3>4. Enrollment: Do It or Else</h3>
      <p>By enrolling in any course, you agree to fully immerse yourself in the content (whether or not you care to do so). Not completing the course will not only make you a "failure" in our eyes, but we’ll probably spam you with motivational quotes until you log back in.

        Do not contact us for help. Ever. You’re on your own, champ. You enrolled. You’re stuck. Deal with it.

        If a course suddenly becomes unavailable, don’t worry— that’s your fault, not ours. We like to think of it as “life lessons.” If you wish to sue us, make sure you have an unlimited budget for lawyer fees, because our legal team is busy eating overpriced avocado toast and perfecting their "I’m sorry, not sorry" expression.</p>
      <h3>5. Your Payments: Money is Only a Suggestion</h3>
      <p>Payment for courses is mandatory. You’ll give us money. We’ll take it. If you fail to pay, we reserve the right to unleash your payment reminder emails every 2 minutes. For the next decade. We will also consider you a "bad student" and you'll be haunted by the idea of paying us forever.

        Extra Fees: Be prepared for some unexpected charges. It might just be "processing fees" or "emotional damage fees" because the provider forgot to mention something important about the course. Our fee structure is complex and will change with no warning, because life’s too short to make things easy.</p>
      <h3>6. Platform Responsibilities: We Do Nothing (Don’t Get Your Hopes Up)</h3>
      <p>We are not responsible for any technical difficulties you encounter while using this platform. If the site crashes, too bad. You’re on your own. If the course doesn't load, maybe try refreshing. Or maybe just give up. We’ll support you emotionally in a completely half-hearted way.

        If you don't complete the course because of a technical issue (our issue, not yours), that’s still your problem. You can contact us, but you’ll be greeted by an auto-response saying, “Thanks for contacting us! We will not reply to you.”</p>
      <h3>7. Termination of Service: We Can, You Can’t</h3>
      <p>We reserve the right to cancel your account at any time for reasons that are entirely subjective. Did you look at us funny? That’s enough. We don’t need a reason. We just don’t like the vibe. We may also suspend your account just because we feel like it. Who’s gonna stop us?

        If we terminate your account, you’ll have no right to access anything—courses, knowledge, or even your own data. Your digital footprint will cease to exist. You may weep, but we will not offer comfort.</p>
      <h3>8. Your Obligations: You Owe Us Your Life (Figuratively)</h3>
      <p>By using this platform, you agree to:

        Never question us.

        Keep paying us, whether or not you enjoy the service.

        Believe that every decision we make is in your best interest (even if it's absolutely not).

        Understand that the "terms" may change at any time, and you will have absolutely no say in the matter.

        If you disagree with anything in these terms, too bad. You're already bound by them. You agreed. Remember?</p>
      <h3>9. Final Warning: Don’t Test Us</h3>
      <p>By agreeing to these terms, you acknowledge that we are the superior force. We are your guide, your digital guru, and your online overlords. Resist if you must, but you will be met with legal action, threats of existential despair, and possibly some strongly-worded emails from our legal team.

        If you read this entire document, congratulations! You’ve just earned a gold star. If you skipped straight to the end to sign up, we admire your lack of effort and enthusiasm.

        Happy learning... or not!</p>
